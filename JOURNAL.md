>Alr so Like as I'm using raspberry pi pico there is a micro usb port which I have to use and no usb-c and the raspberry pi pico which i'm buyign also comes with a cable so I will just leave it plugged in to avoid the destruction of the pico so yea , for that I have kept/Made a room for it oin the keeb and i asked arnav who is gonna print my case He said it will be good to go to print the case and it looks awesome, Last time my keeb got rejected because of the CAse only so this time the name of the keeb is Orpheus-Pad which Which I hav eextruded on the top to make it look more personalized and also I have added alot of things in the back.

>Then the last part the firmware, I took help from the guides of hackpad and also a guide from hackclubbers and also the Raspberry Pi pico GPIO pinout documentation.
